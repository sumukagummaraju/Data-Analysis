# Data-Analysis

The Citi Bikes is a bike sharing platform for commuters to travel around New York City (https://www.citibikenyc.com/). The dataset is made publicly available  from Citi Bikes in NYC. (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) This dataset includes details such as start and end time of the trip, duration of commute, age, gender, duration, start and end location of the trip, subscription type. Transformations are made in terms of adding new columns to make age bins, time of the day (morning, evening, late night), and also if the ride was on a weekday or a weekend for more granularity in future.

Further analysis on the dataset was done on Celonis Snap that provides interactive visualizations and process mining capabilities.
